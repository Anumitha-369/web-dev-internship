        <p>"The Secret" is a self-help book by Rhonda Byrne, first published in 2006, that popularizes the concept of the "law of attraction". </p>

        <p>While praised for its inspirational message, the book has also faced criticism for its lack of scientific basis. </p>
        <p class="title"><b>The Secret Quotes</b><br></p>
<p class="quotes">
    <b>“Decide right now that you are going to think only good thoughts. </b>
<br>At the same time, proclaim to the Universe that all your good thoughts are powerful, and that any negative thoughts are weak.”
<br><b>“You have the power to change anything, because you are the one who chooses your thoughts and you are the one who feels your feelings”.</b>
<br>“If you only do one thing with knowledge of The Secret, use gratitude until it becomes your way of life.”
<br><b>“When you emit the frequency of having received it, the law of attraction moves people, events, and circumstances for you to receive.”</b>
<br>“You get to choose what you want, but you must get clear about what you want. This is your work”.
<br><b>“Receiving involves feeling the way you will feel once your desire has manifested. Feeling good now puts you on the frequency of what you want.”</p></b>
